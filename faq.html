<h1>mod_proxy_html: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>This answers some of the most frequently asked questions
that aren't dealt with (or that people overlook) in the documentation
and the apachetutor tutorial.  <span class="v3">This was written for
Version 2, and most of the questions are moot in Version 3.</span></p>
<h2>Questions</h2>

<h2>Answers</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="charset">Can mod_proxy_html support (charset XYZ) as input?</dt>
<dd><p>In version 2, that depends entirely on libxml2, and your charset
is supported if and only if libxml2 supports it.</p>
<p>In Version 3.1, charset support is much expanded provided
<a href="../mod_xml2enc/">mod_xml2enc</a> is enabled.  It is normally
sufficient just to load mod_xml2enc: it will be configured automatically
if you configure mod_proxy_html using <code>ProxyHTMLEnable</code>.
In a few cases, you may need to customise charset support further using
mod_xml2enc's directives.</p>
<p>Note that some servers send inconsistent and even conflicting charset
information, and may generate unexpected results.  Setting
<code>ProxyHTMLMeta On</code> may help resolve such cases, and will
help diagnose problems with extra debug information in the error log.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="iconv">Can mod_proxy_html support (charset XYZ) as output?</dt>
<dd><p>libxml2 uses <code>utf-8</code> internally for everything.
Generating output with another charset is therefore an additional
overhead, and the decision was taken to exclude any such capability
from mod_proxy_html.  There is an easy workaround: you can transcode
the output using another filter, such as mod_charset_lite.</p>
<p>mod_proxy_html 3 supports output transformation to other
charsets using <code>ProxyHTMLCharsetOut</code>.  This requires
mod_xml2enc to be loaded.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="script">Why does mod_proxy_html mangle my Javascript?</dt>
<dd><p>It doesn't.  Your javascript is simply too badly malformed,
and libxml2's error correction isn't what you expect!
Check it with <a href="http://valet.webthing.com/page/">a validator</a>,
or with libxml2's <tt>xmllint --html</tt>
(which uses the same parser as mod_proxy_html).  Here is
<a href="/mod_publisher/parser.html">a fuller explanation</a>.</p>
<p>The best fix for this is to remove the javascript from your markup,
and import it from a separate <tt>.js</tt> file.  If you have an
irredeemably broken publishing system, you may have to upgrade to
<a href="/mod_publisher/">mod_publisher</a> or resort to a markup-blind
filter such as <a href="/mod_line_edit/">mod_line_edit</a>,
mod_substitute or mod_sed.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="attr">Why doesn't mod_proxy_html rewrite urls in [some attribute]?</dt>
<dd><p>mod_proxy_html versions 1 and 2 are based on W3C HTML 4.01 and
XHTML 1.0 (which are identical in terms of elements and attributes).
It supports all links
defined in W3C HTML, even those that have been deprecated since 1997.
But it does <strong>NOT</strong> support proprietary pseudo-HTML "extensions"
that have never been part of <strong>any</strong> published HTML standard.
Of course, it's trivial to add them to the source.</p>
<p>This has been the most commonly requested feature since mod_proxy_html 2.0
was released in 2004.  Since everyone's requirements are different, it
could not reasonably be satisfied with a simple one-size-fits-all fix.
Version 3 of mod_proxy_html delegates the definition of HTML links to
the system administrator, via the configuration file.
<p>A sample file <tt>proxy_html.conf</tt> is provided, and defines
standard W3C HTML/XHTML.  Note that you MUST include this (or equivalent)
into your configuration, or no links will be rewritten!  If you need to
support nonstandard HTML variants, follow the instructions in
<tt>proxy_html.conf</tt>.</p>
